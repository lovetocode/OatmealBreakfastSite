	<p> I don't remember the exact day but, I believe it was in the month of august in the year <em>2016</em>. In that month in that year I decdied that I wanted to try my hand at writing and composing
	songs. So I took a note book and started wriing. I filled up half a page in pencil. Tnen the next day I revised the song lyrics. I had my first finished song. For several years I make a rought draft
	of on song and a final draft on another songs lyrics. I usually worked on the lryics right after I ate breakfst in the morning. Ocassionally I would work on the lyrics later in the day or right before
	bed.</p>
	<p>I had toyed around with <abbr>LMMS</abbr>. I made a song now and them. I even looked at the documentation a little. I never made many or any songs for years. But, after I started writing lyrics I
	decided to make songs using Lmms. I even read most of the documentation so I could figure out how the program worked. So my compsoing career was off and running. I decided on one week to compose each
	song. Maybe the time frame is to short or maybe its to long. I don't know. I chose a week and have stuck with it. Occassionally I take less than a week to compose a song.</p>
	<p>It waa about the time I started making songs with Lmms that I discovered a program title espeak. I thought now I have a program that I can use to put my lyrics to sound. I did not know if it would
	work so I tried the program. And what do you know. I heard my lyrics leap off the page and into the air. I was elated.</p>.
	<p>Around the time I found espeak I also found lilypond. I always wanted to write sheet music and now I had a tool to do just that. My first songs I did not use lilypond but, eventuall I started 
	using lilypond when I composed all my songs. What fun it is. Someday I hope to use paper and pencil also to write the music notation for my songs.</p>
	<p>When I started composing songs I knew the notes of the chromatic scale but, not much more. So I got books to read and I learned more. I read about drumming, composing, basses, and music theory. I
	never knew music theory could be so fun to learn about. For that matter I never knew that I could learn even the least little bit of music their. In fact the first book I read about music theory I
	did understand much. So I keept reading about music theory. I am no expet on muci theoy but, now I know a little music theory.</p>
	<p>I started by posting the songs I finished onto sound cloud. Now I post my songs on youtube.</p>
	<p>Also I had foold around with blend for years off and on. Never doing anything more than tutorials. Now with the beginning my composing career or hobby I had a reason to make projets with blender. So
	now for everysong I make a cover for my songs with blender. One day I may make animated videos for my songs.</p>
	<p>If I can remember more about the origins of oatmealBreakfast I will update this page.</p>
